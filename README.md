# ML Repository

This repository is dedicated to studying and practicing Machine Learning (ML) concepts, including deep learning, data analysis, and mathematical foundations. It contains a variety of resources, projects, datasets, and cheatsheets to support learning and experimentation.

## Repository Structure

- **cheatsheets/**: Jupyter notebooks and quick references for Calculus, Linear Algebra, Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, OpenCV), and more.
- **Datasets/**: Example datasets for ML projects, including Cat vs. Dog image data for classification tasks.
- **NoteBooks/**: General-purpose notebooks for ML pipelines and experiments.
- **Projects/**: Contains two major subprojects:
	- **AIPND/**: Code and labs from the AI Programming with Python Nanodegree, including linear algebra, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib mini-projects.
	- **deep-learning-v2-pytorch.git/**: Material from Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree, with tutorials and projects on neural networks, CNNs, RNNs, GANs, and more (using PyTorch).
- **checkpoints/**: Model checkpoints for deep learning experiments.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
	 ```bash
	 git clone https://github.com/Emad2018/ML.git
	 cd ML
	 ```
2. Explore the `cheatsheets/` for quick references and learning resources.
3. Check the `Projects/` directory for hands-on labs and deep learning projects.
4. Use the `Datasets/` folder for sample data to practice ML workflows.

## Requirements
- Anaconda

Each project or notebook may have its own dependencies.
For most Python-based notebooks, you can set up a virtual environment and install dependencies with:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
